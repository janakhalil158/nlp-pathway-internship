# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: NLP Internship Tasks  

This repository contains the four Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks I completed as part of my **Elevvo Pathways Internship**.  
Each task demonstrates different NLP techniques ranging from traditional machine learning to modern transformer-based models.

##  Task 1: Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews  
- Built a **binary sentiment classifier** (Positive vs Negative).  
- Preprocessed text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Used **TF-IDF vectorization** to represent text.  
- Trained and evaluated models: **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**.  
- Compared performance and tested predictions on sample reviews.

##  Task 2: News Category Classification  
- Classified news articles into categories (**Sports, Business, Technology, World**).  
- Applied preprocessing and **TF-IDF features**.  
- Trained **Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes** classifiers for multiclass classification.  
- Evaluated with accuracy and classification reports.  
- Visualized frequent words per category using **WordClouds and bar plots**.

##  Task 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER) from News Articles  
- Used **spaCy pre-trained models** to extract entities (PERSON, ORG, GPE, DATE, etc.) from news text.  
- Highlighted recognized entities in context using **spaCy displaCy visualizer**.  
- Counted entity types across the dataset.  
- **Bonus:** Generated **WordClouds** of frequent entities by category (e.g., most common organizations, people).

##  Task 4: Question Answering with Transformers  
- Implemented a **Question Answering system** using Hugging Face Transformers.  
- Loaded a pre-trained **DistilBERT model (fine-tuned on SQuAD)**.  
- Provided a context passage and asked natural language questions.  
- The model extracted the most relevant answer span from the text.  
- Tested with multiple contexts to demonstrate robustness.
